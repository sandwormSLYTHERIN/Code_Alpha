üéôÔ∏è 1. Speech Emotion Recognition using CNN
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from speech audio files. Preprocessed audio by applying silence removal, noise reduction, and extracting features like MFCCs. Trained and evaluated the model using TensorFlow/Keras. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to audio signal processing.

üöó 2. Car Fuel Consumption Prediction
Built regression models to predict vehicle fuel efficiency based on parameters such as engine size, weight, horsepower, and fuel type. Explored multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) and evaluated performance using R¬≤ score and RMSE. Emphasized feature engineering and visual interpretation of relationships within the dataset.

‚ù§Ô∏è 3. Heart Disease Prediction using ML (RF, DT, SVM, KNN)
Designed a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient health records. Applied and compared classifiers like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN. The project included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and ROC-AUC.

üìà 4. Unemployment Analysis
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on unemployment trends in India using real-world datasets. Analyzed variations across states, time periods, gender, and education levels. Created meaningful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight patterns and socio-economic insights. The project focused on drawing policy-relevant conclusions from data.
